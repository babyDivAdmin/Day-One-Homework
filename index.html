            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am a wife and mother to three beautiful kids. I am also a registered nurse and am looking to make a career change out of bedside care. I am hoping that through this training I can move into the technical side of healthcare.</p>

        <div id="why">
            <h3>Why I chose Software Engineering</h3>
            <p> I chose software engineering because I found nursing to be an unsustainable career choice; eventhough I love being a nurse.
                I have always been very interested in tech, but was discouraged from pursuing a career in tech by teachers and college professors.
                I am so excited to be doing what I feel is best for me, despite what anyone else may believe. I am determined to make this career
                change for myself and my children.
